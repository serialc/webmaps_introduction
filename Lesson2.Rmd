# Everything looks like a nail

.pl[
Before making a WebMap, ask yourself:

- Is the concept/idea valid? Does it makes sense cartographically to compared to a static map? 
- What is the best medium to communicate your data?
- Do not think all maps are best shared using WebMaps

# Valid WebMap applications

.pl[
WebMaps are great for exploring or communicating data that necessitate changing scale, area and comparing data to general spatial features (base maps) to comprehend.

To take an example from last lesson, the airline flights example is quite a good example of this. You can focus on an individual airport, specific regions (e.g., Greenland vs Africa) or the world.
If I wanted to improve that map I could make it that clicking on an airport highlights those flights in particular.

# WebMap pyramid of requirements

.tl[
The skills required for WebMap development

- Need to be able to use a computer.
- Understand absolute/relative paths of file structure.
- Understand how WebMaps function and where data is stored.
- Have some cartographic basics.
- Understand some **JS, CSS and HTML** basics.
- Be able to generate and export GIS data.
- Understand some basic data types.
]

???

Last week had some technical background taking time last week, but it’s necessary, and while we will be making WebMaps this week, we’ll continue to use the knowledge from last week and develop new skills.

# Agenda for Lesson 2

.tl[
1. Making and understanding the index file
2. Uploading your web page from last week to the server
3. Creating your first WebMap (Leaflet)
4. Creating a WebMap of flight paths using QGIS
5. Uploading more WebMaps to your server
]

class: inverse, center, middle, activity
# Activity 1

## Making your landing page
.pl[
Note the importance of the index.html file:
- Browsers look for it
]

---

# Creating an HTML start page

.pl[
Download the [zip file](rsrcs/l2/lesson2.zip) for this lesson.

- **Unzip it** (Windows will happily let you look inside without unzipping - that's bad)
- Personalize/edit your welcome/main page (index.html) in your HTML editor of choice.
  - Right click on index.html and “open with…” or open/find index.html from your editor.
  - Make some minor modifications. For example adding your name to the title or heading.
  - Add a link to your 'about me' page from last week's homework.
]

.pr[
- Test it in a browser (**double click** on index.html - it should open in your default browser).
- The link to your 'about me' page should work.

*Being organized and clean in terms of files and folders will be very important*

**For the remainder of the course you will be contributing to building up your website (i.e., this folder's contents).**

# Uploading to a server

**[Our server for this course: 167.99.221.7](http://167.99.221.7/)**

I will individually give you your passwords now
]

???

The purpose of WebMaps is to provide spatial data interaction/exploration **online**. Typically WebMaps are placed within a website providing the context - similar to what you have done in esri’s Story Maps. Hopefully at this stage you have a working mini-website working on your **local machine**.

We need to learn how to put our content on-line.

Placing content on-line requires having a computer permanently on and connected to the internet that is running software that can respond to requests for information, what we call a **server**.

I have spun up a temporary server using **DigitalOcean**. It costs about 5 EUR per month. Cheaper options exist (e.g., 20 EUR/year).

A note on your using this server.
- **Always keep a good copy of your data on your local machine**.
    1. Work on things on your local machine
    2. Get it working
    3. Upload to the server.
- Don't upload very large files, such as videos to the server.
- Don't use the server for any content not related to this course.

This server will not be active beyond the final assignment submission deadline.

# How to upload - Secure FTP

.pl[
There are various methods and tools we can use to upload.

A common introductory method to move files between your computer and the server is FTP (File transfer protocol). We don't use this any more as it's unsafe.

**We now use SFTP** (Secure FTP).

We will use SFTP software called [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client), a good, free, and cross-platform **(S)FTP client**.
]

.pr[

We might talk about using FTP generally but we always mean SFTP.

# FileZilla

.pull-left[
The basics:
- The toolbar allows you to connect/disconnect/configure.
  - The left button allows you to save configurations and quick connect.
- Note the two viewing options on the toolbar's right.
  - Shows you differences.
  - Allows you to explore both your local machine and the server simultaneously.

1. The activity pane.
2. **Your computer**'s directory tree.
3. **Your computer**'s selected directory's contents.
4. **The server**'s directory tree.
5. **The server**'s selected directory's contents.

# FileZilla configuration

.pl[
To connect to the server, configure FileZilla by opening the Site Manager:
- Click the icon in the toolbar at the top left of FileZilla ![FileZilla site manager icon](imgs/l2/fz_site_manager_icon.png). It opens the Site Manager window (to the right).
- On the bottom left click **New site** button and give it a name (e.g., WebMaps course)
- On the right specify the:
  - Protocol: SFTP
  - Host: 167.99.221.7
  - User: [your username]
  - Password: [your password]
- Click **Connect**

# Creating our first WebMap

.pl[
We will now create our first WebMap using the [Leaflet library](https://leafletjs.com/) ([alt](https://leafletjs.com/SlavaUkraini/)).

The [Quick Start Guide](https://leafletjs.com/SlavaUkraini/examples/quick-start/) assumes we have some knowledge of HTML.
- Look in the [zip resources](rsrcs/l2/lesson2.zip) provided for today.
- Duplicate the `resources_wk2/website/ pages/template.html` page and rename it `leaflet_example.html` (or something clear) in the same folder.
- Open `leaflet_example.html` in your code editor of choice (e.g., notepad)
]

.pr[
Follow the instructions on the Quick Start Guide and integrate the resources (CSS, JS, HTML) into your file.
- You must link **two files** and add some HTML, JS, and CSS as well.
- As we covered last week, I strongly recommend you keep the CSS and JS in separate files from the HTML for simplicity for now.

# A tale of two codes

Look in the provided **resources/A_tale_of_two_codes** to see the two files below (here abridged to fit):

# Linking your files

.pull-left[
In the `<head>`:
- Webpage title
- Link to Leaflet CSS
- Link to Leaflet JS
- Link to **your** CSS

In the `<body>`:
- a `<div id="something"></div>` that will contain your WebMap.
- below the above
  - Link to **your** JS
  
**Just like we linked HTML to CSS and JS files, we inside them link back to elements in the HTML, using CSS and JS to refer to elements.

In this exercise the  ```{html}<div id="map"></div>```.

.pull-right[
You will follow the [directions](https://leafletjs.com/SlavaUkraini/examples/quick-start/) for the following sections:
- [Preparing your page](https://leafletjs.com/SlavaUkraini/examples/quick-start/#preparing-your-page)
- [Setting up the map](https://leafletjs.com/SlavaUkraini/examples/quick-start/#setting-up-the-map)

# Mapbox

.pull-left[
As you've seen from the previous exercise, the tiles you are using belong to Mapbox, created from OSM data.

As we will not be generating our own tiles in this course **we need to use someone's image tiles**. Mapbox's business is providing tools and resources, such as these tiles.

There are many sources of map tiles, many of which you must register and retrieve a `key` to be able to use.

If you exceed certain usage limits you will be cut-off and required to pay to continue.

Unless you have a popular site or WebMap you're unlikely to reach the non-free tiers from Mapbox or other services.
]

.pull-right[

Many alternative map [sources](http://openwhatevermap.xyz) exists to Mapbox:

.w50[[![WebMap containing various tile sources](imgs/l2/xyztiles.png)](http://openwhatevermap.xyz)]

Either update your `L.tileLayer` source (and attribution!) to an alternative source or register with Mapbox and update the `accessToken`:

.ts[
- http://{s}.basemaps.cartocdn.com/dark_all/{z}/{x}/{y}{r}.png
- http://{s}.basemaps.cartocdn.com/light_all/{z}/{x}/{y}{r}.png
- https://stamen-tiles-{s}.a.ssl.fastly.net/watercolor/{z}/{x}/{y}.jpg
- https://stamen-tiles-{s}.a.ssl.fastly.net/toner-lite/{z}/{x}/{y}{r}.png
- http://{s}.tiles.maps.sputnik.ru/{z}/{x}/{y}.png
- http://tileserver.memomaps.de/tilegen/{z}/{x}/{y}.png
]
]

???

You can now go back to do the activity, you must choose whether to use the Mapbox tiles or another resource.

Feel free to ask each other for assistance, or myself.

# An alternative WebMaps method using QGIS

.pl[
We will dive straight into another activity. Making a WebMap of certain flight paths of your choice.

The process is as follows:

1. Import the data into QGIS
2. Select desired features
3. Change symbology of features
4. Install plugins (qgis2web & QuickMapServices)
5. Create/export WebMap
]

.pr[
The data for this exercise is provided in the [zipped resources](rsrcs/l2/lesson2.zip) provided for today.
- Again, assure you unzip the data

Explore how to do the following activities in QGIS:
- Add data (flight_paths_ALL_WGS84)
- Open attribute table
- Select feature/attributes using an expression
- Export selection
- Styling a layer's properties
- Installing plugins
- Adding a base map (QuickMapServices)
- Export a WebMap (qgis2web)

# Upload both WebMaps from today

.pl[
**You must keep your individual WebMap files very organized in separate folders.**

If your files for this course are a mess things will become much much harder to resolve for you.

Beyond just updating these two maps, you must update your main index.html file that we worked on first today, **to point/link to the two new maps**.
